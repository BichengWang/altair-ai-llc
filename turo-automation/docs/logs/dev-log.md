### Repo bootstrap
- Created `turo-automation/` under `/Users/mac/my-code/altair-ai-llc`
- Added docs-first structure:
  - `docs/architecture/`
  - `docs/logs/`
  - `docs/planning/`
  - `docs/product/`
  - `docs/runbooks/`
- Added application folders:
  - `web/`
  - `worker/`
  - `shared/`
- Added root `README.md`
- Added `docs/planning/daily-plan.md`
- Added `docs/logs/dev-log.md`

### Initial direction
- Goal: automate Turo host daily operations without over-automating risky workflows on day 1
- Recommendation: start with detection, task routing, message drafting, and approvals before enabling autonomous guest-facing sends
- MVP focus areas:
  1. trip ops dashboard
  2. task orchestration
  3. guest messaging draft workflow
  4. incident / late-return alerting
  5. daily summary reporting

### Added runbook
- Added `docs/runbooks/ai-workflow-hourly.md`
- Established the hourly development loop: review state, choose one highest-priority PR, implement incrementally, verify, update PR, and keep docs synchronized with reality

### First runbook execution
- Reviewed current repo state, open PRs, recent commits, and docs inventory
- Chose the highest-priority ready task: document the implementation roadmap and draft the MVP data model
- Added `docs/planning/implementation-roadmap.md`
- Added `docs/architecture/data-model.md`
- Updated `docs/planning/daily-plan.md` to reflect completed planning work and the next executable step

### Second runbook execution
- Reviewed current repo state again from `main`
- Confirmed there were no open PRs and the next ready task was the app skeleton milestone
- Initialized an executable workspace under `turo-automation/` with:
  - `package.json` and npm workspaces
  - `tsconfig.base.json`
  - `web/` Vite + React shell
  - `worker/` TypeScript worker entrypoint
  - `shared/` shared package for common exports
  - `.gitignore` for local build artifacts and dependencies
- Updated the root `README.md` to describe package roles
- Updated `docs/planning/daily-plan.md` to mark the app skeleton milestone complete

### Decision
- The next highest-priority implementation PR should add the first Supabase schema/migration slice for `vehicles`, `guests`, `trips`, and `tasks`
- Reason: the executable workspace now exists, so the next bottleneck is persistent data structure for the operational dashboard and worker flows

### Verification
- Ran `npm install` inside `turo-automation/`
- Ran `npm run build` successfully for:
  - `@turo-automation/shared`
  - `@turo-automation/worker`
  - `@turo-automation/web`

### Pending
- Add the first Supabase schema/migration slice
- Build the first internal dashboard shell beyond placeholder content
- Add worker job framework for scheduled automation
- Connect shared domain models to persistence and UI
